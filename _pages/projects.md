# Starting September 2025 - B-GRASP Project 

The Bayesian Gutenberg-Richter Analysis for understanding Seismic Processes (B-GRASP) project aims to better quantify the b-value parameter in the Gutenberg-Richter law to improve seismic hazard knowledge. Using advanced Bayesian tools, I will estimate when and why this parameter changes before large earthquakes in seismically active areas, and provide refined seismic hazard maps for less active areas such as Spain and France. I will be carrying out this research under the guidance of Dr. Bodin, expert in Bayesian statistics for the geosciences, and his research team at the Institut de Ci√®ncies del Mar - Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (ICM-CSIC) in Barcelona.

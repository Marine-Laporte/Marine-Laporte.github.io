# Starting September 2025 - B-GRASP Project 

The Bayesian Gutenberg-Richter Analysis for understanding Seismic Processes (B-GRASP) project aims to better quantify the b-value parameter in the Gutenberg-Richter law to improve seismic hazard knowledge. Using advanced Bayesian tools, I will estimate when and why this parameter changes before large earthquakes in seismically active areas, and provide refined seismic hazard maps for less active areas such as Spain and France. I will be carrying out this research under the guidance of Dr. Bodin, expert in Bayesian statistics for the geosciences, and his research team at the Institut de Ciències del Mar - Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (ICM-CSIC) in Barcelona. 

# Collaboration Cyrielle Colin's PhD thesis
Cyrielle Colin works on b-value and seismic rates estimations from historical and instrumental catalogs for seismic hazard assessment. We work together on developing a 2D transdimensional code using voronoï cells to invert for spatial variations of b-value and seismic rate. 

# Collaboration on the ANR ShallowDepthDL 
During my PhD I was interested in estimating depth of shallow earthquakes using seismic network at regional and teleseismic distances. I particularly developed a code for estimating hypocentral depths at teleseismic distances using envelopes of teleseismic signals.
